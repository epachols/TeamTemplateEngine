  ## Description
  
 This node/js app uses class extensions and the inquirer NPM module to take Command Line Input from the user to generate an HTML page displaying pertinent information about software team members, including their role, name, employee ID, and other role-based information.
  
  ## Installation
  
 This app utilizes the NPM Inquirer module and its dependencies, run the command line "npm install" from the command line while in the develop folder in this project. For this app to run properly and generate a page, all file structure must remain intact within this system, including the "output" folder.
  
  
  ## Usage 
  

  From the develop folder, run the command line "node app.js". This will lead the user through a series of prompts intended to gather information about the Manager (singular) and team members (of varying number) before rendering the information on separate cards, lightly stylized in an html file called "team.html" within the "output" folder in the "develop" folder in this repo.
